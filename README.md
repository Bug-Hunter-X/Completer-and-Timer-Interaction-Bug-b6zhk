# Dart Completer and Timer Interaction Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the interaction between `Completer` and `Timer` in Dart. The issue arises when using a `Timer` to complete a `Completer` that is not handled appropriately. When the main function completes before the timer completes, the `Completer` may not complete gracefully, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `bug.dart` file.
3. Observe the potential unhandled exception.
